    "# Quantum Transformer Architecture for Molecular Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "This research notebook presents a conceptual implementation of a **Quantum Transformer** architecture designed for sequence modeling, with a focus on molecular representation. We explore the translation of classical transformer components - specifically Self-Attention, Positional Encoding, and Feed-Forward Networks - into their quantum mechanical counterparts. Using **PennyLane** as the quantum simulation framework, we demonstrate how quantum interference via the SWAP test can serve as an attention mechanism, and how variational quantum circuits can function as trainable transformation layers. We explicitly acknowledge the simulation nature of this implementation and discuss the theoretical advantages alongside the significant challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, such as barren plateaus and scalability constraints."

    "## 1. Background Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Classical Transformers\n",
    "The Transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing by relying entirely on the **attention mechanism** to draw global dependencies between input and output. The core operation is the Scaled Dot-Product Attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q$ (Query), $K$ (Key), and $V$ (Value) are matrices derived from the input embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Motivation for Quantum Transformers\n",
    "Quantum computing offers a unique perspective on attention:\n",
    "- **Exponential State Space**: An $n$-qubit system represents a $2^n$-dimensional complex vector space, potentially allowing for richer embeddings of high-dimensional molecular data.\n",
    "- **Interference**: Quantum algorithms naturally compute inner products (similarity) between states via interference, which is mathematically analogous to the dot product in attention mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Entanglement**: Quantum states can represent correlations between particles (qubits) that classical statistical models struggle to capture efficiently, making them promising for modeling electron correlations in molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Limitations for Molecules\n",
    "Classical graph neural networks and transformers treat atoms as discrete nodes with classical feature vectors. They often require heavy approximations to model quantum mechanical properties like orbital interactions or superposition, which are native to a quantum computing framework."

    "- **Superposition**: The ability to be in state $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC)**: Quantum circuits with tunable parameters $\\theta$. These are the \"neural networks\" of the quantum world.\n",
    "- **Measurement**: Extracting information from the quantum state, typically calculating the expectation value $\\langle Z \\rangle$."
